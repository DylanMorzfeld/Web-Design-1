            <h2>Mars Expedition Alpha</h2>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Partial Success</p>
            <p><strong>What went right:</strong> Landing sequence executed flawlessly. Crew maintained stable vitals for 98% of the mission.</p>
            <p><strong>What went wrong:</strong> Dust storms overwhelmed solar collectors. Communication delays caused navigation uncertainty.</p>
            <p><strong>Prevention for future missions:</strong> Reinforced dust shields, emergency nuclear battery backup, AI-assisted pathfinding.</p>

            <h2>Titan Deep Scan Operation</h2>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Mission Failure</p>
            <p><strong>What went right:</strong> Probe deployment achieved perfect orbit. Data recording systems were stable.</p>
            <p><strong>What went wrong:</strong> Cryo-methane storms disabled surface drones.</p>
            <p><strong>Prevention for future missions:</strong> Hardened chassis, sub-surface navigation, autonomous retreat algorithms.</p>

        <div class="mission-card">
            <h2>Lunar Rescue Mission Omega</h2>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Major Success</p>
            <p><strong>What went right:</strong> Emergency response was immediate, crew evacuation completed in record time.</p>
            <p><strong>What went wrong:</strong> Faulty oxygen distribution system in the original base.</p>
            <p><strong>Prevention for future missions:</strong> Mandatory structural audits, redundant oxygen regulators, constant remote diagnostics.</p>
